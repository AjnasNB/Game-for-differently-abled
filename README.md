# Game-for-differently-abled
## This is a simple 2d game I developed for a startup to connect with their device and the device sens√© the movement and give necessary input to game which results in the movements of sprites in the game. 

## The game is based on the following:
### 1. A sprite is created for the player
### 2. The player can move left, right, up and down
### 3. The player has to move the sprite to the left, right, up and down with their body movement by standing still.
### 4. The player can also move the sprite up and down with their body movement by standing still.
### 5. The device connected to game detects the chane in our body and give coordinates to game
### 6. The game identifies coordinates and move it.
### 7. Its amore like an excercise to the differently abled people.
